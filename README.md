In this 2D game, you take control of a fairy whose goal is to jump on clouds and light up stars while avoiding obstacles. The fairy is equipped with a magical wand that she can use to light up the stars, which are scattered throughout the levels.

Written using the MLX 42 lib.

Main features:

- the fairy can jump + move left or right;
- the fairy can also die if she either runs into mobs multiple times or reaches the bottom border (don't let her do that, please!);
- there are two types of mobs, and each of them has its own animation;
- the witch flies from left to right, changing y-axis (height) after reaching one of the borders;
- bats fly randomly (left, right, up, and down) in the central area, depending on what rand() returns;
- there are idle animations for bats and the fairy;
- a star appears and starts pulsating when the main character reaches the cloud above which it is located;
- a cloud disappears if the star above it lights up;
- there is a floating animation for clouds;
- there is also a heart container in the upper left corner displaying lives left.
